I expect a proper attitude with which a professor can motivate his students to study, and not send us an article when the time for the lecture comes, instead of an actual lecture. This is farcical. I don't want teachers to force our presence when they are unable to turn on the microphone and share a screen. I expect at the very least the lecture material to be sent to us after the lecture in the group mail, as is done in any university. I can go on indefinitely, but I am skeptical that this poll will change anything. Rather, it is for activity reporting. Thanks!"

The fact is that this helps students be assessed in the given discipline, but causes a lot of discomfort, such as headache from standing in front of the computer, back pain from standing for long hours in front of a laptop or computer, for people wearing glasses this may increase diopters, etc. Moreover, in general, isolation leads to depression. It would be much more effective for a student of Finance, for example, to work in a bank for 4 hours a day than to write homework or listen to a lecture, especially if he/she is a student in their third or fourth year."

I have no specific recommendations, because it can be seen that each of our professors does everything possible to make the learning process both useful and entertaining, because it is difficult to keep students’ attention in an online room for so long."
