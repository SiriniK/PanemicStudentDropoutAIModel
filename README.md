# PanemicStudentDropoutAIModel
AI Model to predict student dropouts during the pandemic

In this study we look at a dataset from a journal article titled "Impact of lockdown on university studentsâ€™ learning process during the COVID-19 pandemic in Southern Central Bulgaria". The authors wanted to study the impact of the COVID-19 on students in Bulgaria. During the lockdown, these students were forced to attend classes remotely. Some students indicated that they will be discontinuing their education due to the impact of the pandemic. Our study will focus on coming up with an AI model to predict what students will be discontinuing their education. Please see https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wt8g7dth8y/1 for details about the journal article and the dataset used.

This will help administrators intervene early and attempt to prevent these students from dropping out. The model will also be helpful if we are to face another pandemic.

This project contains the code to use sentiment analysis to convert text comments to an integer. After that IBM Waston Data Studio's AutoExperiment is to develop the model.
